# Requirements

This document highlights the scope and requirements of this application.

## Functional Requirements

1. Show a 3D Rubik's Cube.
2. We should be able to pan the cube and rotate the cube.
3. We should be able to solved the cube by taking actions.
4. The application will have **2 starting points**:
    - *Input the faces* of an unsolved cube.
    - Generate a *random unsolved structure*.
5. There should be **hints** to solve the cube.
6. There should be an **auto-solver** option.

7. Explore possibility to generalize the cube (more than 3x3 grid)
8. Instead of direct complicated algorithms, explore the possibility to use Genetic Algorithm or similar to solve the cube.
9. A timer to show the time taken.
10. Number of moves away from solving.
11. Ability to interact with the cube using keyboard.
12. Ability to interact with the mouse.
13. Feedback tab

## Technical Requirements
1. Frontend time to first render <1s p95
2. State management in the frontend with async updates/retrievals from the backend.
3. Backend response time <200ms p90
4. Cloud hosting
5. CI/CD so that auto-redeploy on push to main branch
6. Dockerized environments
